Where is this algorithm used in practice?

Code Assist: The Huffman coding algorithm, which is closely related to the minCostRope method, has numerous practical applications in various fields, including:

Data Compression: Huffman coding is widely used in lossless data compression algorithms, such as gzip, zip, and PNG image compression. It helps reduce the size of digital data by assigning shorter codes to more frequently occurring symbols.
Text Encoding: Huffman coding is used in text encoding schemes like ASCII and Unicode to efficiently represent characters using variable-length binary codes.
Image and Video Compression: Huffman coding is employed in image and video compression standards like JPEG, MPEG, and H.264/AVC to compress discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients and other data.
Audio Compression: Huffman coding is used in audio compression formats like MP3 and AAC to compress audio data.
Network Protocols: Huffman coding is utilized in network protocols like HTTP/2 and SPDY to compress headers and improve transmission efficiency.
Database Systems: Some database systems, such as MySQL and PostgreSQL, use Huffman coding to compress data stored in tables and indexes.
Embedded Systems: Huffman coding is applied in embedded systems, like microcontrollers and real-time operating systems, to optimize memory usage and improve performance.
Scientific Computing: Huffman coding is used in scientific computing applications, such as climate modeling and genomics, to compress large datasets and reduce storage requirements.
Cloud Storage: Cloud storage services like Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage employ Huffman coding to compress data stored in their systems.
Machine Learning: Huffman coding can be used in machine learning models to compress and represent large amounts of data, such as images and text, in a more efficient manner.

explain this code in bullet points
Algorithm Steps:
Initialize a priority queue pq to store the rope lengths.
Add all elements from the input array arr to the priority queue.
While there are more than one elements in the priority queue:
Remove the two smallest rope lengths (ropeOne and roteTwo) from the priority queue.
Calculate the combined length (combine) by adding ropeOne and roteTwo.
Update the result variable by adding the combined length (combine) to it.
Add the combined length back into the priority queue.
Return the calculated minimum cost (result).

what is the space and time complexity of this code
Time Complexity: The time complexity of the minCostRope method is O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the input array.
Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(n), as we need to store all elements in the priority queue.
